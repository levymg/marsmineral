	<h3>Mars Mineral Launches Pelletized Limestone Website</h3>
	<p>Mars, Pa.,February, 19, 2002 -- Mars Mineral, the leader in agitation pelletizing technology for various materials, has created <a href="http://www.pelletizedlimestone.com" target="_blank">www.pelletizedlimestone.com</a>, a specialized Web site for quarry operators and agricultural producers that is devoted to the production and use of pelletized limestone. The site includes information on how limestone is pelletized, technical papers, lab testing data, FAQs and more</p>
	<p>&quot;Limestone pelletizing has distinct benefits for quarry operators, as well as for Ag product manufacturers, distributors and retailers,&quot; says Clayton Woodward, president of Mars Mineral. &quot;Quarry operators can create a new revenue stream by converting dust into value-added product.&quot; Companies that deal in agricultural products can produce or sell this superior product, while improving product selection and handling, and generating additional revenue.&quot;</p>
