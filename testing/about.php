            <h1>About Mars Mineral</h1>
            
            <p>Mars Mineral specializes in agitation pelletizing. This is a process that converts fine dusts and powders into spherical- shaped pellets. This process is accomplished without the need of pressure or heat, but rather an agitation of the material in the presence of a binder, usually just water. This action forms "seed" pellets that can be as small as 50 mesh, increasing in size up to 1" diameter.</p>
      		<p>The benefits of pelletizing include the elimination of fine dust particles and the improvement of material flowability and densifying. This results in reduced worker exposure to dust particles, improved environmental conditions in your plant, the ability to recycle, reuse or produce a saleable product, or simply to provide a non-dusty product for disposal.</p>
      		<p>This pelletizing method has been widely accepted in various industries, including steel, foundry, chemical, mining, cement, lime and fertilizer. </p>
      		<p>To provide the best pelletizing device for your application, Mars Mineral offers the following services to test your material, evaluate the results and manufacture pelletizers or pelletizing systems. </p>
            
      		<h3>Material Testing</h3>
      		<p>Mars Mineral maintains a complete testing laboratory facility that is equipped to pelletize materials from a few pounds sample through a few tons. The test equipment ranges from bench scale through pilot scale sizes. </p>
      		
            <h3>Equipment Rental</h3>
      		<p>Once testing is completed, equipment is available for onsite testing and/or pilot scale operation. This arrangement allows for the customer to produce a large quantity of pellets for evaluation, plant trials and sustained runs. This also provides a time for the operators to gain knowledge in the operation of the pelletizing equipment. </p>
