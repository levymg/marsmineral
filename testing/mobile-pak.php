            <p>Ideal for dust generators, the Mars Mobile-Pak is a versatile solution to dust recycling and disposal. The system includes a dust storage bin, bin activator, volumetric feeder, mixing screw, pelletizer, pellet load-out conveyor, dust collector and electrical controls, all mounted on a portable trailer, which is easily transported to any site. Ready for operation after only one electrical and one water connection, the Mobile-Pak can be customized with a variety of pelletizers and can use a number of wet and dry binding agents. </p>
			
            <p>Dusts are collected in drums fitted with specially designed spouts to eliminate dusting. The drum, designed to be moved with most fork lifts, rotates to a dumping position for dust loading. Where space permits, the Mobile-Pak can be positioned directly under an existing dust storage bin for pelletizing. </p>
			
            <p>The standard Mobile-Pak capacity ranges from 200 to 6000 pounds per hour, depending upon the type of pelletizer used and the material being processed. </p>
